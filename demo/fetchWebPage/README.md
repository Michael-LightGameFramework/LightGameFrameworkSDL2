# WebText
## A test of the SDL2_net library.
I created WebText class to try and fetch txt files from websites. 
It works just as well to fetch the source html for webpages, so that's neat.
HTTPS sites seem to be a problem, not sure how to fix that yet.
Just playing round with things, but it was a fun project.
