# Demo Page
This is the folder where all the demos for the Light Game Framework will go. 

I'll post a couple of my proof of concept games on here, but I'd really like to be able to post your creations as well so I can share them with other viewers of the YT channel.

(currently leave a message on one of my YT videos about sharing a file and/or fork this git repo and add your demo folder then do a pull request)

See the Pong demo as an example of how you might set a demo folder up.
