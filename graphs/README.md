# Daily Short Share Volume
Represents the daily short sales volume of a stock in the key markets. Not all stocks or all markets are included, but to best of my ability.

If this program hasn't been run in several days it may need up to a minute to download the daily market data.

These files only need to be fetched once, as they are a CSV of all shorted stocks. The files are stored in the "./res" folder.

To request data for apple, run like this:

TODO:
I've got a label to travel over whatever square you highlight. It shows as "date: shares", though the date is not easy to read since it has no hashmarks. It's late tonight, I'll try to remember to fix this...
